                <h3>Introduction to Coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, enjoyed by millions of people every day for
                    its rich flavor,
                    energizing effects, and cultural significance. It is made from roasted seeds—commonly called coffee
                    beans—of the Coffea plant,
                    which grows mainly in tropical regions such as Latin America, Africa, and Asia.</p>

                <p>
                    From strong espresso shots to creamy lattes, coffee brings comfort, energy, and joy.
                    Across the globe, coffee has become a symbol of community, creativity, and culture.
