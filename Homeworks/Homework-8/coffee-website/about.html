                <h3>Origins in Ethiopia</h3>
                <p>
                    Coffee is believed to have been discovered in <strong>Ethiopia</strong> around the 9th century.
                    According to legend, a goat herder named <strong> Kaldi</strong> noticed his goats became unusually
                    energetic after eating red coffee cherries.
                    Curious, Kaldi tried the cherries himself, and the stimulating effects of coffee were discovered.

                <h3>Spread to the Arab World</h3>
                <p>
                    By the 15th century, coffee had reached Yemen and other parts of the Arab world.
                    The Arabs were the first to <strong>roast and brew coffee beans</strong> as a drink.
                    Coffeehouses, called <strong>qahveh khaneh</strong>, became centers for socializing, discussion,
                    music, and learning.

                <p>
                    Coffee reached <strong>Europe</strong> in the 17th century, first in Italy, then spreading to
                    England, France, and the Netherlands.
                    It quickly became popular in coffeehouses, which were nicknamed “penny universities” because people
                    could gain knowledge while enjoying a cup of coffee.

                        cultivation</strong> to the Americas and Asia.
                    Today, coffee is grown in tropical regions around the world, with <strong>Brazil, Vietnam, and
                        Colombia</strong> being the top producers.
